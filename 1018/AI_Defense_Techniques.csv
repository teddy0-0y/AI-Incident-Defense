deceive.js,Deceive,Technique,,AID-DV-001,Honeypot AI Services & Decoy Models/APIs,"Deploy decoy AI systems, such as fake LLM APIs, ML model endpoints serving synthetic or non-sensitive data, or imitation agent services, that are designed to appear valuable, vulnerable, or legitimate to potential attackers. These honeypots are instrumented for intensive monitoring to log all interactions, capture attacker TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures), and gather threat intelligence without exposing real production systems or data. They can also be used to slow down attackers or waste their resources."
deceive.js,Deceive,Technique,,AID-DV-002,"Honey Data, Decoy Artifacts & Canary Tokens for AI","Strategically seed the AI ecosystem (training datasets, model repositories, configuration files, API documentation) with enticing but fake data, decoy model artifacts (e.g., a seemingly valuable but non-functional or instrumented model file), or canary tokens (e.g., fake API keys, embedded URLs in documents). These \""honey\"" elements are designed to be attractive to attackers. If an attacker accesses, exfiltrates, or attempts to use these decoys, it triggers an alert, signaling a breach or malicious activity and potentially providing information about the attacker's actions or location."
deceive.js,Deceive,Technique,,AID-DV-003,Dynamic Response Manipulation for AI Interactions,"Implement mechanisms where the AI system, upon detecting suspicious or confirmed adversarial interaction patterns (e.g., repeated prompt injection attempts, queries indicative of model extraction), deliberately alters its responses to be misleading, unhelpful, or subtly incorrect to the adversary. This aims to frustrate the attacker's efforts, waste their resources, make automated attacks less reliable, and potentially gather more intelligence on their TTPs without revealing the deception. The AI might simultaneously alert defenders to the ongoing deceptive engagement."
deceive.js,Deceive,Technique,,AID-DV-004,AI Output Watermarking & Telemetry Traps,"Embed imperceptible or hard-to-remove watermarks, unique identifiers, or telemetry \""beacons\"" into the outputs generated by AI models (e.g., text, images, code). If these outputs are found externally (e.g., on the internet, in a competitor's product, in leaked documents), the watermark or beacon can help trace the output back to the originating AI system, potentially identifying model theft, misuse, or data leakage. Telemetry traps involve designing the AI to produce specific, unique (but benign) outputs for certain rare or crafted inputs, which, if observed externally, indicate that the model or its specific knowledge has been compromised or replicated."
deceive.js,Deceive,Technique,,AID-DV-005,Decoy Agent Behaviors & Canary Tasks,"For autonomous AI agents, design and implement decoy or \""canary\"" functionalities, goals, or sub-agents that appear valuable or sensitive but are actually monitored traps. If an attacker successfully manipulates an agent (e.g., via prompt injection or memory poisoning) and directs it towards these decoy tasks or to exhibit certain predefined suspicious behaviors, it triggers an alert, revealing the compromise attempt and potentially the attacker's intentions, without risking real assets."
deceive.js,Deceive,Technique,,AID-DV-006,Deceptive System Information,"When probed by unauthenticated or suspicious users, the AI system provides misleading information about its architecture, capabilities, or underlying models. For example, an API might return headers suggesting it's built on a different framework, or an LLM might respond to 'What model are you?' with a decoy answer."
deceive.js,Deceive,Technique,,AID-DV-007,Training-Phase Obfuscation for Model Inversion Defense,"A deception technique that defends against model inversion attacks by intentionally adding controlled noise or obfuscation during the model's training phase. By making the relationship between inputs, outputs, and the model's internal parameters less deterministic, the resulting model becomes a 'noisier' and more opaque oracle. This deceives and frustrates an attacker's attempts to reconstruct sensitive training data from the model's outputs."
deceive.js,Deceive,Technique,,AID-DV-008,Poisoning Detection Canaries & Decoy Data,"This technique involves proactively embedding synthetic 'canary' or 'sentinel' data points into a training set to deceive and detect data poisoning attacks. These canaries are specifically crafted to be easily learned by the model under normal conditions. During training, the model's behavior on these specific points is monitored. If a data poisoning attack disrupts the overall data distribution or the training process, it will cause an anomalous reaction on these canaries (e.g., a sudden spike in loss, a change in prediction), triggering a high-fidelity alert that reveals the attack without the adversary realizing their method has been detected."
detect.js,Detect,Technique,,AID-D-001,Adversarial Input & Prompt Injection Detection,"Implement mechanisms to continuously monitor and analyze inputs to AI models, specifically looking for characteristics indicative of adversarial manipulation or malicious prompt content. This includes detecting statistically anomalous inputs (e.g., out-of-distribution samples, inputs with unusual perturbation patterns) and scanning prompts for known malicious patterns, hidden commands, jailbreak sequences, or attempts to inject executable code or harmful instructions. The goal is to block, flag, or sanitize such inputs before they can significantly impact the model's behavior or compromise the system."
detect.js,Detect,Technique,,AID-D-002,AI Model Anomaly & Performance Drift Detection,"Continuously monitor the outputs, performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, confidence scores, precision, recall, F1-score, output distribution), and potentially internal states or feature attributions of AI models during operation. This monitoring aims to detect significant deviations from established baselines or expected behavior. Such anomalies or drift can indicate various issues, including concept drift (changes in the underlying data distribution), data drift (changes in input data characteristics), or malicious activities like ongoing data poisoning attacks, subtle model evasion attempts, or model skewing."
detect.js,Detect,Technique,,AID-D-003,AI Output Monitoring & Policy Enforcement,"Actively inspect the outputs generated by AI models (e.g., text responses, classifications, agent actions) in near real-time. This involves enforcing predefined safety, security, and ethical policies on the outputs and taking action (e.g., blocking, sanitizing, alerting) when violations are detected."
detect.js,Detect,Technique,,AID-D-004,"Model & AI Artifact Integrity Monitoring, Audit & Tamper Detection","Regularly verify the cryptographic integrity and authenticity of deployed AI models, their parameters, associated datasets, and critical components of their runtime environment. This process aims to detect any unauthorized modifications, tampering, or the insertion of backdoors that could compromise the model's behavior, security, or data confidentiality. It ensures that the AI artifacts in operation are the approved, untampered versions."
detect.js,Detect,Technique,,AID-D-005,"AI Activity Logging, Monitoring & Threat Hunting","Establish and maintain detailed, comprehensive, and auditable logs of all significant activities related to AI systems. This includes user queries and prompts, model responses and confidence scores, decisions made by AI (especially autonomous agents), tools invoked by agents, data accessed or modified, API calls (to and from the AI system), system errors, and security-relevant events. These logs are then ingested into security monitoring systems (e.g., SIEM) for correlation, automated alerting on suspicious patterns, and proactive threat hunting by security analysts to identify indicators of compromise (IoCs) or novel attack patterns targeting AI systems."
detect.js,Detect,Technique,,AID-D-006,Explainability (XAI) Manipulation Detection,"Implement mechanisms to monitor and validate the outputs and behavior of eXplainable AI (XAI) methods. The goal is to detect attempts by adversaries to manipulate or mislead these explanations, ensuring that XAI outputs accurately reflect the model's decision-making process and are not crafted to conceal malicious operations, biases, or vulnerabilities. This is crucial if XAI is used for debugging, compliance, security monitoring, or building user trust."
detect.js,Detect,Technique,,AID-D-007,Multimodal Inconsistency Detection,"For AI systems processing multiple input modalities (e.g., text, image, audio, video), implement mechanisms to detect and respond to inconsistencies, contradictions, or malicious instructions hidden via cross-modal interactions. This involves analyzing inputs and outputs across modalities to identify attempts to bypass security controls or manipulate one modality using another, and applying defenses to mitigate such threats."
detect.js,Detect,Technique,,AID-D-008,AI-Based Security Analytics for AI systems,"Employ specialized AI/ML models (secondary AI defenders) to analyze telemetry, logs, and behavioral patterns from primary AI systems to detect sophisticated, subtle, or novel attacks that may evade rule-based or traditional detection methods. This includes identifying anomalous interactions, emergent malicious behaviors, coordinated attacks, or signs of AI-generated attacks targeting the primary AI systems."
detect.js,Detect,Technique,,AID-D-009,Cross-Agent Fact Verification & Hallucination Cascade Prevention,"Implement real-time fact verification and consistency checking mechanisms across multiple AI agents to detect and prevent the propagation of hallucinated or false information through agent networks.

detect.js,Detect,Technique,,AID-D-013,RL Reward & Policy Manipulation Detection,This technique focuses on monitoring and analyzing Reinforcement Learning (RL) systems to detect two primary threats: reward hacking and reward tampering. Reward hacking occurs when an agent discovers an exploit in the environment's reward function to achieve a high score for unintended or harmful behavior. Reward tampering involves an external actor manipulating the reward signal being sent to the agent. This technique uses statistical analysis of the reward stream and behavioral analysis of the agent's learned policy to detect these manipulations.
detect.js,Detect,Technique,,AID-D-014,RAG Content & Relevance Monitoring,"This technique involves the real-time monitoring of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system's behavior at inference time. It focuses on two key checks: 1) Content Analysis, where retrieved document chunks are scanned for harmful content or malicious payloads before being passed to the LLM, and 2) Relevance Analysis, which verifies that the retrieved documents are semantically relevant to the user's original query. A significant mismatch in relevance can indicate a vector manipulation or poisoning attack designed to force the model to use unintended context."
detect.js,Detect,SubTechnique,AID-D-001,AID-D-001.001,Per-Prompt Content & Obfuscation Analysis,"Performs real-time analysis on individual prompts to detect malicious content, prompt injection, and jailbreaking attempts. This sub-technique combines two key functions: 1) identifying known malicious patterns and harmful intent using heuristics, regex, and specialized guardrail models, and 2) detecting attempts to hide or obscure these attacks through obfuscation techniques like character encoding (e.g., Base64), homoglyphs, or high-entropy strings. It acts as a primary, synchronous guardrail at the input layer."
detect.js,Detect,SubTechnique,AID-D-001,AID-D-001.002,Synthetic Media & Deepfake Forensics,"Detects manipulated or synthetically generated media (e.g., deepfakes) by performing a forensic analysis that identifies a combination of specific technical artifacts and inconsistencies. This technique fuses evidence from multiple indicators across different modalities—such as image compression anomalies, unnatural biological signals (blinking, vocal patterns), audio-visual mismatches, and hidden data payloads—to provide a more robust and reliable assessment of the media's authenticity."
detect.js,Detect,SubTechnique,AID-D-001,AID-D-001.003,Vector-Space Anomaly Detection,"Detects semantically novel or anomalous inputs by operating on their vector embeddings rather than their raw content. This technique establishes a baseline of 'normal' inputs by clustering the embeddings of known-good data. At inference time, inputs whose embeddings are statistical outliers or fall far from the normal cluster centroids are flagged as suspicious. This is effective against novel attacks that bypass keyword or pattern-based filters by using unusual but semantically malicious phrasing."
detect.js,Detect,SubTechnique,AID-D-001,AID-D-001.004,LLM Guardrail for Intent/Privilege Escalation,"Use a fast secondary LLM (guardrail) to classify prompts for intent switching, instruction bypass, or privilege escalation before reaching the primary model."

It involves defining and enforcing strict, machine-readable policies about which tools an agent can use, with what parameters, and in what sequence. The detection mechanism is a real-time policy engine that validates each proposed action against these rules before it is executed, acting as a critical guardrail against unintended or malicious agent behavior."

The core principle is to analyze the relationship between the graph's connectivity (structure) and the attributes of its nodes (features). By identifying and then pruning or down-weighting anomalous edges that violate expected structure-feature properties (e.g., connecting highly dissimilar nodes), this technique creates a revised, more robust graph for the GNN's message passing, hardening it against structural poisoning."
detect.js,Detect,SubTechnique,AID-D-012,AID-D-012.003,Structural & Topological Anomaly Detection,"Detects potential poisoning or backdoor attacks in graphs by analyzing their topological structure, independent of node features.

model.js,Model,SubTechnique,AID-M-003,AID-M-003.002,Performance & Operational Metric Baselining,"Establishes a quantitative, empirical baseline of a model's expected behavior under normal conditions. This involves calculating and recording two types of metrics: 1) key performance indicators (e.g., accuracy, precision, F1-score) on a trusted, 'golden' dataset, and 2) operational metrics (e.g., inference latency, confidence scores, output distributions) derived from simulated or live traffic. This documented baseline serves as the ground truth for drift detection, anomaly detection, and ongoing performance monitoring."
model.js,Model,SubTechnique,AID-M-003,AID-M-003.003,Explainability (XAI) Output Baselining,"Establishes a baseline of normal or expected outputs from eXplainable AI (XAI) methods for a given AI model. By generating and documenting typical explanations (e.g., feature attributions, decision rules) for a diverse set of known, benign inputs, this technique creates a reference point to detect future anomalies. A significant deviation from this baseline can indicate that an attacker is attempting to manipulate or mislead the explanation method itself to conceal malicious activity, as investigated by AID-D-006."
model.js,Model,SubTechnique,AID-M-003,AID-M-003.004,Agent Goal & Mission Baselining,"Specifically for autonomous or agentic AI, this technique involves formally defining, documenting, and cryptographically signing the agent's core mission, objectives, operational constraints, and goal hierarchy. This signed 'mission directive' serves as a trusted, immutable baseline. It is a critical prerequisite for runtime monitoring systems (like AID-D-010) to detect goal manipulation, unauthorized deviations, or emergent behaviors that contradict the agent's intended purpose."
model.js,Model,SubTechnique,AID-M-003,AID-M-003.005,Generative Model Inversion for Anomaly Pre-screening,"Utilizes a generative model (e.g., a Generative Adversarial Network - GAN) to establish a baseline of 'normal' data characteristics. An input, such as an image, is projected into the model's latent space to find a vector that best reconstructs the input. A high reconstruction error suggests the input is anomalous, out-of-distribution, or potentially a synthetic deepfake not created by a similar generative process. This technique models the expected data fidelity to pre-screen inputs for potential threats."
model.js,Model,SubTechnique,AID-M-003,AID-M-003.006,Graph Energy Analysis for GNN Robustness,"Utilizes metrics derived from a graph's adjacency matrix, such as graph subspace energy, as a quantifiable indicator of a Graph Neural Network's (GNN) robustness to adversarial topology perturbations. By modeling and baselining these structural properties, this technique can guide the development of more inherently resilient GNNs, for instance, by enhancing adversarial training to generate perturbations that are not only effective but also structurally significant according to the energy metric."
model.js,Model,SubTechnique,AID-M-003,AID-M-003.007,Self-Supervised Discrepancy Analysis for GNN Backdoor Defense,"Employs self-supervised learning to train an auxiliary Graph Neural Network (GNN) model that learns the intrinsic semantic information and attribute importance of nodes without using potentially poisoned labels. This process creates a trusted baseline model of 'normal' node characteristics. This baseline is then used as a reference to detect discrepancies—such as semantic drift or attribute over-emphasis—in a primary GNN trained on the potentially compromised data, which is a foundational step for identifying and mitigating backdoor attacks."
model.js,Model,SubTechnique,AID-M-005,AID-M-005.001,Design - Secure Configuration Baseline Development,"Covers the 'design' phase of creating and documenting secure, hardened templates and configurations for all AI system components, based on industry benchmarks. This proactive technique involves defining 'golden standard' configurations for infrastructure, containers, and AI platforms to ensure that systems are secure by default, systematically reducing the attack surface by eliminating common misconfigurations before deployment."
model.js,Model,SubTechnique,AID-M-005,AID-M-005.002,Pre-Deployment - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security Scanning,"Covers the 'pre-deployment' phase of automatically scanning Infrastructure as Code (IaC) files (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation, Bicep, Kubernetes YAML) in the CI/CD pipeline. This 'shift-left' security practice aims to detect and block security misconfigurations, policy violations, and hardcoded secrets before insecure infrastructure is ever provisioned in a live environment."
model.js,Model,SubTechnique,AID-M-005,AID-M-005.003,Post-Deployment - Configuration Drift & Posture Monitoring,Covers the 'post-deployment' phase of using Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) tools and custom scripts to continuously monitor live cloud environments. This technique aims to detect and alert on 'configuration drift'—unauthorized or accidental changes that cause a system to deviate from its established secure baseline—providing a real-time view of the security posture for all AI system components.
model.js,Model,SubTechnique,AID-M-006,AID-M-006.001,HITL Checkpoint Design & Documentation,"This sub-technique covers the initial development phase of implementing Human-in-the-Loop controls. It involves formally defining the specific triggers that require human intervention in code and configuration, implementing the technical hooks for the AI agent to pause and await a decision, and creating the clear Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that operators will follow when an intervention is required."
model.js,Model,SubTechnique,AID-M-006,AID-M-006.002,HITL Operator Training & Readiness Testing,"Covers the human and procedural readiness aspects of a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) system. This technique involves developing comprehensive training programs and running simulated emergency scenarios ('fire drills') for human operators. It also includes regularly auditing and testing the technical HITL mechanisms to ensure both operator preparedness and end-to-end functionality, confirming that human control can be asserted effectively and reliably when needed."
model.js,Model,SubTechnique,AID-M-006,AID-M-006.003,HITL Escalation & Activity Monitoring,"Covers the live operational and security aspects of a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) system. This technique involves defining and implementing the technical escalation paths for undecided or unhandled intervention requests and ensuring that all HITL activations, operator decisions, and system responses are securely logged.

restore.js,Restore,Technique,,AID-R-002,Data Integrity Recovery for AI Systems,"Restore the integrity of any datasets used by or generated by AI systems that were corrupted, tampered with, or maliciously altered during a security incident. This includes training data, validation data, vector databases for RAG, embeddings stores, configuration data, or logs of AI outputs. Recovery typically involves reverting to known-good backups, using data validation tools to identify and correct inconsistencies, or, in some cases, reconstructing data if backups are insufficient or also compromised."
restore.js,Restore,Technique,,AID-R-003,Secure Session & Identity Re-establishment,"After an eviction (AID-E-005) is complete, this technique re-establishes clean, trusted interactions for users and AI agents. It focuses on hardening the recovery process by enforcing strong re-authentication (MFA/step-up), ensuring modern TLS, restoring clean conversational context from trusted snapshots, and progressively re-enabling capabilities. This includes clear communication with legitimate users and maintaining heightened monitoring to detect and prevent immediate re-compromise."
restore.js,Restore,Technique,,AID-R-004,"Post-Incident Review, Hardening & Communication","Following recovery from a security incident, conduct a thorough, blameless review of the attack to identify the root cause. Based on these lessons learned, reinforce security controls, update threat models, perform targeted testing to validate fixes, and communicate the incident details to relevant internal and external stakeholders. This comprehensive process ensures that vulnerabilities are addressed, system resilience is improved, and knowledge is shared to prevent recurrence and improve collective defense."
restore.js,Restore,Technique,,AID-R-005,Rapid Vector Index Rollback & Quarantine,"Implement fast, reliable recovery procedures for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system's vector index after a poisoning attack has been detected. This technique relies on versioning the index to enable rapid rollback to the last known-good state. It also includes mechanisms to quarantine suspicious document chunks, removing them from the active index for forensic analysis while maintaining the availability of the rest of the system. The goal is to minimize service disruption and ensure the restored index is clean and trustworthy."
restore.js,Restore,SubTechnique,AID-R-001,AID-R-001.001,Versioned Model Rollback & Restoration,Name of the model to roll back
restore.js,Restore,SubTechnique,AID-R-001,AID-R-001.002,Model Retraining for Remediation,"This sub-technique covers the restoration workflow for when a model's integrity has been compromised by its training data (e.g., via data poisoning or backdoor attacks). It involves a multi-stage process: first, identifying and removing the malicious data or client influence; second, retraining a new model from scratch using only the resulting sanitized dataset; and third, validating that the new model is both secure and performant. This approach is more comprehensive than a simple rollback and is necessary when no trusted model backup exists."
